## Key Features
- Seamlessly toggle between Light, Dark, and a special "Custom" theme.
- User theme preference is saved in localStorage, ensuring the choice remains after a page reload.
- Utilizes CSS Grid with `@supports` for a complex, masonry-style gallery that is fully responsive.
- Smooth CSS transitions for colors and backgrounds, plus interactive hover effects using `filter` (`blur` and `hue-rotation`).
- Dropdown menu for theme selection.
