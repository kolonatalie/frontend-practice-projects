# Tabs Project | [Live Preview](https://job-experience-tabs.vercel.app)

Job experience dashboard. This project was originally a tutorial from **[John Smilga's React course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo&t)**. I have upgraded it by migrating from Create React App to **Vite**, refactoring to **TypeScript**, and integrating **GSAP** for polished web animations.

## Key Upgrades & Features

* Migrated to **Vite** for near-instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds.
* Fully refactored to **TypeScript** with custom interfaces.
* Powered by **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** to provide smooth transitions between tab content.
* Configured **ESLint** and **Stylelint** (with recess-order) to maintain "FAANG-level" code quality and consistent CSS property ordering.
* #### Inspiration
  * [Gatsby Strapi Portfolio](https://gatsby-strapi-portfolio-project.netlify.app/)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React** (v18+)
* **TypeScript** (v5+)
* **Vite** (Build Tool)
* **GSAP** & **@gsap/react** (Animations)
* **ESLint 9** & **Stylelint** (Code Quality)

##  Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    
    `git clone` [`https://github.com/kolonatalie/frontend-practice-projects.git`](https://github.com/kolonatalie/frontend-practice-projects.git)

2.  **Navigate to the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend-practice-projects/Projects/tabs
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the application in development mode:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will open at `http://localhost:3000`.


###  Production Build

To create an optimized production bundle:
```bash
npm run build
```
The output will be generated in the dist/ directory.
