# Menu Project | [Live Preview](https://menu-kolonatalie.vercel.app)

Responsive restaurant menu app built with a focus on clean code, performance, and high-end user experience. This project was originally a JavaScript tutorial from **[John Smilga's React course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo&t)**, which I have upgraded by refactoring to **TypeScript** and integrating **GSAP** for high-end web animations.

## Key Features

* **Dynamic Filtering.** Instant menu updates based on categories (Breakfast, Lunch, Shakes, etc.).
* Powered by **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** for smooth, staggered entry animations.
* Fully refactored to **TypeScript** to ensure robust code and prevent runtime errors.
* **Responsive Design.** Mobile-first approach with a clean, modern UI.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **React** (v18+)
* **TypeScript** (v5+)
* **GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform) & **@gsap/react**

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    
    `git clone` [`https://github.com/kolonatalie/frontend-practice-projects.git`](https://github.com/kolonatalie/frontend-practice-projects.git)
    
2.  **Navigate to the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend-practice-projects/Projects/menu
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies (using legacy peer deps for CRA compatibility):**
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The application will open in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.
