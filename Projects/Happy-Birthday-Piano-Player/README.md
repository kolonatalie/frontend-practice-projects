# Happy Birthday Piano Player
An interactive mini-game to help beginner piano students learn and practice.

This project is a piano player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using DOM events to play notes.
It’s part of my learning journey on the Front-End path with [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com).
