# Whale Talk Translator

A cool JavaScript project that translates regular human phrases into **Whale Talk** — a language spoken slowly and only in vowels (as per Codecademy's challenge).

## Description

This program takes any input phrase and converts it into its "Whale Talk" equivalent by following a few rules:

- Only vowels are used (A, E, I, O, U — no Y).
- The vowels **"e"** and **"u"** are considered **extra long**, so they are **doubled** in the translation.
- The final output is in **UPPERCASE**, as whale sounds are loud.

## Example

### **Input:** 
Code is like humor - if you have to explain it, it’s probably not that good

### **Output:**  
OEEIIEEUUOIOUUAEEOEEAIIIOAOAOO

## Concepts Used

- `for` loops
- `if` statements
- `Array.push()`
- `Array.join()`
- `String.toUpperCase()`


## Future Ideas

- Visualize whale talk translation on a webpage
- Add support for custom vowel elongation
