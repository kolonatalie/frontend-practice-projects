# **Advanced Accordion** (*TypeScript & GSAP Animation*)

An interactive Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) component. This project was originally a JavaScript tutorial from **[John Smilga's React course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo&t)**, which I have significantly upgraded by refactoring to **TypeScript** and integrating **GSAP** for high-end web animations.

## Features

* **Single Open Logic.** A streamlined UX where opening one question automatically closes any other active one.
* **GSAP Powered Animations.** Smooth, high-performance transitions for opening and closing content, providing a "premium feel" compared to standard CSS.
* **Interactive SVG Toggle.** A custom-styled plus icon that rotates 45 degrees into a cross when active, using CSS transforms.
* **Fully Responsive.** Mobile-first design that works seamlessly across all devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **React** (v18+)
* **TypeScript** (v5+)
* **GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform)
* **React Icons**

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    
    `git clone` [`https://github.com/kolonatalie/frontend-practice-projects.git`](https://github.com/kolonatalie/frontend-practice-projects.git)
    
2.  **Navigate to the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend-practice-projects/Projects/accordion
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies (using legacy peer deps for CRA compatibility):**
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The application will open in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.
