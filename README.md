# 🛠️ Frontend Practice Projects
 
This repository is part of my learning journey as I study frontend development, primarily through Codecademy, IT courses and hands-on experimentation.

Each project in this repo focuses on building a small, functional feature using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — everything from simple games to interactive web components.


## ✨ Why this repo exists

-  To provide a tangible demonstration of the concepts and skills I'm acquiring. Think of it as a living portfolio of my early steps in web development.
-  To track my evolution as a developer and reflect on the challenges I've overcome.
-  I hope these simple projects can be a useful resource for other beginners who are also navigating the exciting path of frontend development. Feel free to explore the code, adapt it, and learn from it!


## 📁 What you'll find here

-  Rock-Paper-Scissors (+ secret lava mode!) - JavaScript
-  Sleep Debt Calculator - JavaScript
  
*(This section will be dynamically updated as I add projects.*


## 📌 Disclaimer

These projects are for learning purposes only. They may be simple, imperfect, or evolving — and that’s the point. 😊
Feel free to fork or use the code in your own experiments!
