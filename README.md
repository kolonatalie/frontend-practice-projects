# Frontend Practice Projects
 
This repository is part of my learning journey as I study frontend development, primarily through Codecademy, IT courses and hands-on experimentation.

Each project in this repo focuses on building a small, functional feature using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** ‚Äî everything from simple games to interactive web components.
